# Due date: Sunday April 7th before midnight
# Write your answers in the space between the questions, and commit/push only this file to your repo.
# Note that there can be a difference between giving a "minimally" right answer, and a really good
# answer, so it can pay to put thought into your work.

# Part 1: Introductory Python (to be done without defining functions or classes)

# Question 1.1: Using a for loop, write code that takes in any list of objects, then prints out:
# "The value at position __ is __" for every element in the loop, where the first blank is the
# index location and the second blank the object at that index location.

my_list = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

for index in range(len(my_list)):
    print("The value at position {} is {}".format(index, my_list[index]))

# Question 1.2: A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same both forwards and backwards. Write
# code that takes a variable of any string, then tests to see whether it qualifies as a palindrome.
# Make sure it counts the word "radar" and the phrase "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", while
# rejecting the word "Microsoft" and the phrase "This isn't a palindrome". Print the results of these
# four tests.

test_strings = [
    "radar",
    "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!",
    "Microsoft",
    "This isn't a palindrome"
]

for test in test_strings:
    clean_test = ''.join(c for c in test if c.isalpha()).lower()
    if clean_test == clean_test[::-1]:
        print(test + "is a palindrome")
    else:
        print(test + "is not a palindrome")

# Question 1.3: The code below pauses to wait for user input, before assigning the user input to the
# variable. Beginning with the given code, check to see if the answer given is an available
# vegetable. If it is, print that the user can have the vegetable and end the bit of code.  If
# they input something unrecognized by our list, tell the user they made an invalid choice and make
# them pick again. Repeat until they pick a valid vegetable.

available_vegetables = ['carrot', 'kale', 'broccoli', 'pepper']

while True:
    choice = input('Please pick a vegetable I have available: ')
    if choice in available_vegetables:
        print("You can have " + choice)
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid Choice, try again")

# Question 1.4: Write a list comprehension that starts with any list of strings and returns a new
# list that contains each string in all lower-case letters, unless the modified string begins with
# the letter "a" or "b", in which case it should drop it from the result.

strings = ['A', 'b', 'C', 'd', 'E', 'f']

filtered_strings = []

for s in strings:
    s = s.lower()
    if not s.startswith(("a", "b")):
        filtered_strings.append(s)

print(filtered_strings)

# Question 1.5: Beginning with the two lists below, write a single dictionary comprehension that
# turns them into the following dictionary: {'IL':'Illinois', 'IN':'Indiana', 'MI':'Michigan', 'WI':'Wisconsin'}

short_names = ['IL', 'IN', 'MI', 'WI']
long_names  = ['Illinois', 'Indiana', 'Michigan', 'Wisconsin']

state_dict = {short_names[i]: long_names[i] for i in range(len(short_names))}

print(state_dict)

#############
# Part 2: Functions and classes (must be answered using functions\classes)

# Question 2.1: Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments, then
# sums them together. If the sum is greater than 10, return the string 
# "big", if it is equal to 10, return "just right", and if it is less than
# 10, return "small". Apply the function to each tuple of values in the 
# following list, with the end result being another list holding the strings 
# your function generates (e.g. ["big", "big", "small"]).

start_list = [(10, 0), (100, 6), (0, 0), (-15, -100), (5, 4)]
def sum_function(a, b):
    total = a + b
    if total > 10:
        return "big"
    elif total == 10:
        return "just right"
    else:
        return "small"
result = [sum_function(a, b) for a, b in start_list]
print(result)

# Question 2.2: The following code is fully-functional, but uses a global
# variable and a local variable. Re-write it to work the same, but using one
# argument and no global variable. Use no more than two lines of comments to
# explain why this new way is preferable to the old way.

## This new way is better because you can modify the variables calculated
## in the function through argument.
def my_func(a):
    b = 40
    return a + b
x = my_func(10)
print(x)

# Question 2.3: Write a function that can generate a random password from
# upper-case and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters 
# (!@#$%^&*). It should have an argument for password length, and should 
# check to make sure the length is between 8 and 16, or else print a 
# warning to the user and exit. Your function should also have a keyword 
# argument named "special_chars" that defaults to True.  If the function 
# is called with the keyword argument set to False instead, then the 
# random values chosen should not include special characters. Create a 
# second similar keyword argument for numbers. Use one of the two 
# libraries below in your solution:
#import random
#from numpy import random

import random
import string

def random_password():
    while True:
        length = int(input("Enter the password length (8-16): "))
        if 8 <= length <= 16:
            break
        else:
            print("Password length must be between 8 and 16.")

    special_chars = input("Include special characters? (yes/no): ").lower()

    characters = string.ascii_letters
    characters += string.digits

    if special_chars == "yes":
        characters += "!@#$%^&*" 
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    print("Generated password: " + password)

random_password()

# Question 2.4: Create a class named MovieDatabase that takes one argument
# when an instance is created which stores the name of the person creating
# the database (in this case, you) as an attribute. Then give it two methods:
#
# The first, named add_movie, that requires three arguments when called: 
# one for the name of a movie, one for the genera of the movie (e.g. comedy, 
# drama), and one for the rating you personally give the movie on a scale 
# from 0 (worst) to 5 (best). Store those the details of the movie in the 
# instance.
#
# The second, named what_to_watch, which randomly picks one movie in the
# instance of the database. Tell the user what to watch tonight,
# courtesy of the name of the name you put in as the creator, using a
# print statement that gives all of the info stored about that movie.
# Make sure it does not crash if called before any movies are in the
# database.
#
# Finally, create one instance of your new class, and add four movies to
# it. Call your what_to_watch method once at the end.

import random

class MovieDatabase:
    def __init__(self, creator_name):
        self.creator_name = creator_name
        self.movies = []

    def add_movie(self, name, genre, rating):
        self.movies.append({'name': name, 'genre': genre, 'rating': rating})

    def what_to_watch(self):
        if not self.movies:
            print("No movies in the database yet.")
            return
        movie = random.choice(self.movies)
        print(f"Hi {self.creator_name}, you should watch '{movie['name']}'! It's a {movie['genre']} movie with a rating of {movie['rating']}.")

username = input("Please enter user name: ")
my_movie_db = MovieDatabase(username)

my_movie_db.add_movie('John Wick 1', 'Action', 5)
my_movie_db.add_movie('John Wick 2', 'Action', 5)
my_movie_db.add_movie('John Wick 3', 'Action', 5)
my_movie_db.add_movie('John Wick 4', 'Action', 5)
